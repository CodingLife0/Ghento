# Ghento ✨

Ghento is a python coded discord bot intended for practitional purposes. Please bear in mind that the bot is still in development stages and users may experience initial server errors and malfunctioning. I am not to blame for any damaged caused by these errors. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements file.
1. Use a virtual env or cd to your directory and install the file. This command can also be copy pasted.

```bash

```

## Usage
The bot features a default !help command as seen below.
